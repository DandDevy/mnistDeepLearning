# predictingHandWrittenNumbersDeepLearningNeuralNetwork
I made this during a weekend in the summer. 
I had been watching videos for a while on neural networks and I had heard of TensorFlow, so wanted to try it out.

I made this in the mnist_Ep1.ipynb file on Jupyter Notebook. 

.ipynb files are strugglying to load on github. 

So I downloaded it as python and put it here so it would be easier to view.
mnist_Ep1.py wasn't actually created or used while making this.
Just made so the actual code could be viewed on github in mnist_Ep1.ipynb

I had followed a tutorial by https://www.youtube.com/user/sentdex
